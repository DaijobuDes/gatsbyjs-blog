Actually got bored from doing anything due to this
community quarantine, in order to kill time, I have coded a
discord bot made in Python.

Since I am interested on programming and bots on how they work
and how are they coded. Of course, I made it out of boredom, and it
worked pretty well.

My goal for this bot is to use this for moderation, and still
slowly implementing it.

So, if ever you have a discord server, feel free to invite my bot
using this [OAuth Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=732431209312944190&permissions=8&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost&scope=bot)

Since it is open-source, the public repo is
[here at Github](https://github.com/DaijobuDes/daijobuudes)

Here is a preview of the bot.

P.S. My bot is self-hosted, not in any kind of VPS services.
