So, in these days, we all know that in this kind of generation,
everyone has a gadget to use, commonly used are phones and personal
computers. But what about your information?

In the internet, you should never ever reveal your personal information
which are sensitive like your credit card, personal ID's or any kind of
personal identification which are very sensitive.

As a social media user, you should know how would you share your
information to others, especially if that social media platform involves
the using of usernames, in order to hide or it serves as a cloak from your
real name. Especially [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), a social media platform
which I consider as **"way too personal"** since we use our real names there.
But Facebook also filters people who are not in your country or even not your
friend's friend (friends of friends). But in posting, it is recommended that you
do not include your real information there, and/or post something way too personal.

So, I am also a [Discord](https://discord.com) user, which involves the use of 
usernames, chat or talk to people from other countries. And as I have been using
Discord for two years now. I have seen some people use this platform for
malicious use like, selling information through DMs or direct messages
(also termed as PMs or private messages), even distribute malware, still through direct
messages since no one can ban them on servers unless caught and will be reported
to the Discord Team for violating the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

I only share my personal information, not credit card details or alike, to people that
I know, or my friends and to websites that are legitimate in order for verification
purposes and use their services.

tl;dr, don't ever share your personal information everywhere in the public internet, not
only your information is compromised but your identity also is.
