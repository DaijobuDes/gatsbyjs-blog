### Week 1 experiences using the MADE4Learners framework.

Online classes have started August 17, 2020. This is actually my
first time having online classes so it would probably be hard
for me to adapt. Especially if devices are limited, a low-end
laptop, and a slow and expensive internet.

As online classes start, we currently used [Zoom](https://zoom.us), [Google Meets](https://meet.google.com) and probably [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software).
It can still be hard especially if internet connection is slow, 
making the audio sound robotic, and stuck video. And especially the Moodle server gets down in some times.

Although internet problems can be a burden in online classes,
it shouldn't be a problem unless internet is cut off, it is a big
problem to me. Using mobile data can be very wasteful, especially
if data is limited. When it comes to using video, it would probably use up to `1 GB` of data in an average of one hour.

Low-end devices like low spec'd laptops, can sometimes be
frustrating when a program loads very slowly, and when it comes
to video conferencing, sometimes the program hangs due to
high cpu usage, also crashing the program. The laptop camera
sometimes would not respond resulting to display a black screen
only. And microphone laptop has static feedback but good thing
that video conferencing programs has noise suppression by
default, resulting to less static feedback being heard by others
and a clearer voice when speaking.
